<br/>
_No REST for the `wikid`_ :jack_o_lantern: - generate a SQLite database and a spaCy `KnowledgeBase` from Wikipedia & 
Wikidata dumps. `wikid` was designed with the use case of named entity linking (NEL) with spaCy in mind.
<br/>
Note this repository is still in an experimental stage, so the public API might change at any time.
