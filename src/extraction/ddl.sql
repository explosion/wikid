-- DDL for parsed Wiki data.

-- Note that the four tables entities, entities_texts, articles, and article_texts could be combined into one table.
-- Two reasons why this isn't done:
--  1. For efficient full-text search we're using FTS5 virtual tables, which don't support index lookup as efficient as
--     an index lookup in a normal table. Hence we split the data we want to use for full-text search from the
--     identifiying keys (entity/article IDs).
--  2. All article data could just as well be part of the entities and/or entities_texts. This is not done due to the
--     sequential nature of our Wiki parsing: first the Wikidata dump (entities) are read and stored in the DB, then the
--     Wikipedia dump (articles). We could update the entities table, but this is less efficient than inserting new
--     records. If profiling shows this not to be a bottleneck, we may reconsider merging these two tables.

CREATE TABLE entities (
    -- Equivalent to Wikidata QID.
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    -- Claims found for this entity.
    -- This could be normalized. Not worth it at the moment though, since claims aren't used.
    claims TEXT
);

-- The FTS5 virtual table implementation doesn't allow for indices, so we rely on ROWID to match entities.
-- This isn't great, but with a controlled data ingestion setup this allows for stable matching.
-- Same for foreign keys.
